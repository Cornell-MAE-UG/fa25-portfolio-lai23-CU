## Step 1a — Problem Definition, Constraints, Objectives, and Design Degrees of Freedom

### Problem Definition
The purpose of this project is to design a 2D lifting mechanism inside a 150 cm × 50 cm workspace using one rigid bar, three pin supports (two fixed to the ground), and a linear actuator from the provided catalog. The mechanism must lift the maximum possible weight to the highest possible vertical position. In Step 1, all elements are assumed rigid.

### Constraints
- Mechanism must fit within a 150 cm × 50 cm design space.
- Exactly three pin joints; two must be mounted on the ground.
- Bar length is chosen by the designer but behaves as a rigid body.
- Only the maximum actuator force from the selected model may be used.
- Static equilibrium must be satisfied.
- All motion occurs in a 2D plane.

### Objectives
1. Maximize the lifting height of the mechanism.
2. Maximize the supported weight.
3. Identify an optimal compromise using weight–height tradeoff analysis.

### Design Degrees of Freedom
- Bar length
- Ground pin 1 location
- Ground pin 2 location
- Location of third pin (bar pivot)
- Actuator model selection
- Actuator ground anchor position
- Actuator attachment point on the bar
- Initial and final bar angles
- Weight application point
- Overall geometric layout of the mechanism

## Step 1b — Static Analysis of the Rigid Mechanism

To evaluate each possible configuration of the lifting mechanism, I performed a static analysis treating the bar and actuator as rigid bodies. The objective was to determine how much weight the actuator can lift as a function of the lifting height. This required computing the geometry of the mechanism, the moment arms generated by the applied forces, and the actuator’s mechanical advantage.

### 1. Geometric Model
For each candidate pivot height, the horizontal distance to the bar’s upper joint was computed from the design-space boundary:

\[
x_{\text{joint}} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{L_x}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{y_{\text{joint}}}{2}\right)^2}.
\]

From this, the bar length and the actuator length follow directly from their respective attachment coordinates. These geometric quantities determine the actuator angle:

\[
\theta = \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{y_{\text{joint}}}{\ell_{\text{actuator}}}\right).
\]

### 2. Static Equilibrium
The lifting capacity depends on the moment equilibrium about the bar’s pivot.  
The actuator applies a force \(F_{\text{act}}\) along its axis, while the lifted weight \(W\) produces a downward force at the bar’s free end.

The moment generated by the actuator is:

\[
M_{\text{act}} = F_{\text{act}} \, r_{\perp},
\]

where \(r_{\perp}\) is the perpendicular distance between the actuator line of action and the pivot.

The resisting moment from the lifted weight is:

\[
M_W = W \cdot r_W,
\]

where \(r_W\) is the bar’s vertical moment arm.

Setting moments equal at the limit of lifting:

\[
F_{\text{act}} \, r_{\perp} = W_{\max} \, r_W.
\]

This yields:

\[
W_{\max} = F_{\text{act}} \left(\frac{L_{\text{bar}}/y_{\text{joint}}}{\sin \theta} \right),
\]

which shows how weight capacity changes with geometry and bar angle.

### 3. Height–Weight Tradeoff
For each possible joint height, the corresponding maximum supported weight was computed using the equilibrium expression above. This produced a curve describing the fundamental tradeoff:

- Higher lift height ⇒ shorter actuator moment arm ⇒ lower weight capacity  
- Lower lift height ⇒ larger moment arm ⇒ greater weight capacity

To identify a balanced design, the tradeoff curve was normalized and the **knee point** was selected (the point farthest from the line connecting the two extremes). This represents the configuration with the best compromise between height and weight.

### 4. Final Rigid-Bar Design
The optimal configuration corresponds to:

- **Lift height:** (13.14) cm  
- **Maximum supported weight:** (270275.63) N  

This design is used as the baseline geometry for Step 2, where the bar is no longer treated as rigid but analyzed as a bending beam.
